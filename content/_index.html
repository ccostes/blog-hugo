        I am an engineer in a very literal sense: I love understanding how things work to solve problems and build cool things! 
        I'm also very curious, finding something interesting about almost anything, with interests and <a href="/projects">projects</a> 
        as eclectic as my taste in music (ie: very). Most of my time is focussed on building software, and I occasionally write 
        things here about what I'm up to.
