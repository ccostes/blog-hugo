####  Hi there!
My name is Chris, and I'm a developer that loves building things and learning how stuff works. I spend a lot of my time working on embedded real-time applications, but do anything from web development to assembly bootloader hacking, depending on the task at hand.

I've been telling myself that I need to put up a blog for longer than I care to admit, but after many attempts that I was never quite happy with, I think I've finally found a nifty setup that Just Works&trade;. 

Rather than a CMS, which seemed overkill for what I need, I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that works really well for blogs. Compiling the whole site to static HTML pages makes it super-fast, but even better is how simple hosting becomes. GitHub has built-in support for Jekyll sites, and will host one personal site (like this one!) for free. It is also possible to serve a Jekyll site using Amazon's S3 for almost unlimited scalability as well as improved performance and uptime, which I may switch to in the future, but for now the simplicity of hosting on GitHub works for me.

The goal of all of this is to have a platform where I can write about projects, research, and anything else that will be (hopefully) interesting and helpful to others.
